        <p> Glancing at the clock again you see the time. </p>
        <h3> 2:40pm. </h3>
        <p> Thankfully it's not too late. There is still time in the night to get some sleep. </p>
        <p> Although, you feel as if something bad will happen if you open your eyes again. </p>
        <p> Perhaps it's a good idea to try to stay asleep. Afterall, there is something important waiting for you tomorrow? </p>
