Live demo: https://kurolunaa.github.io/4208-HW1-2025/
Repo: https://github.com/kurolunaa/4208-HW1-2025

## Pitch
You need to get a good night's rest, but unfortunately you get the feeling something unsettling is off and messing with you. Could it be aliens? Ghosts? Or perhaps even sleep paralysis demons?

## How to Play
- Click “Time to go to sleep.” on the landing page.
- When prompted, pick one of two choices: Keep your eyes closed, or open your eyes.

## Tech
- HTML (multi-page), CSS (external stylesheets)
- Optional: Minimal JS for simple interactions and assistance with CSS styling

## Repo Layout
- `index.html` — landing & start
- `/game` — scenes, styles, scripts, assets
- `/docs` — `flowchart.png` or `.pdf`, notes
