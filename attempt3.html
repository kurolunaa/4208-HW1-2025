        <p> At least that's what you tell yourself. </p>
        <p> What felt like an eternity, and yet you feel like you've been fully awake this whole time. </p>

        <p> But then you hear something. </p>
        <p> If you open your eyes, maybe you'll be able to find out what it is. Maybe, even what time it is. </p>
        <h4> Do you open your eyes, and find out what awaits you? </h4>
