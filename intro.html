        <p> You wake up in the middle of the night, dazed, and unable to gather your surroundings. </p>
        <p> With your eyes still closed, you twist and you turn, attempting to get to the colder side of the bed. </p>

        <p> But it's not enough. You wonder if you should open your eyes, just so you can peek at the time. </p>
        <p> If you open your eyes, all that will be on your mind is if you will get enough sleep. </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <a id = 'attempt1' href = "attempt1.html"> Keep your eyes closed, and remain still. </a> </li>
            <li> <a id = 'open1' href = "open1.html"> Open your eyes. </a> </li>
        </ul>
