        <h1> You opened your eyes and you noticed a dark figure standing in front of your bed. </h1>
        <hr>

        <p> It's too dark to make out any other detail other than a silhouette. </p>
        <p> You consider getting out of bed to investigate but then you realize.. </p>

        <h4> You can't move. </h4>
        <p> You have no choice but to stare back. </p>
        <p> Eventually it fades away, as the sun slowly peeks it's head. </p>
        <p> But somewhere deep inside you, something feels off. </p>
