        <h1> You slept a little too well. </h1>
        <hr>

        <p> Infact, you glance over at the clock, and it's 2pm. </p>
        <p> Your phone's alarm did not wake you up. </p>
        <p> And you have 5 missed calls. </p>

        <h4> Whatever was waiting for you early in the morning, you missed completely. </h4>
        <p> If only you got out of bed sooner. </p>
        <p> That is, if you really are awake. What was it you missed exactly? </p>
        <p> How long have you been here? </p>

        <a id = 'intro' href = "intro.html"> Is this even the first time you've been here? </a>
