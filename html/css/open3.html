        <p> This is your room, right? </p>
        <p> It feels like it, but something feels off. </p>

        <p> You look at your clock and notice the time. </p>

        <h4> It's 3:33am. </h4>

        <p> The lights turn on, way too on. You aren't in your room. </p>
        <p> Surrounded by monitors, all of them turn on at the same time. </p>
