        <hr>

        <p> Afterall, you are almost about to fully fall asleep. </p>
        <p> Any attempt to opening your eyes now would be really bad, even for the amount of sleep you might get. </p>

        <p> Eventually the sounds stop. </p>

        <p> At this point all you can do is just stay asleep. </p>
