        <h1> You opened your eyes, and was pleasantly surprised. </h1>
        <hr>

        <p> You woke up 2 minutes before your alarm, the time is 5:58am.</p>
        <p> This whole time you didn't realize it but you've been asleep the whole time. </p>
        <p> But for how long? </p>
        <p> There is no way for you to find out, but you can only guess. </p>

        <h4> But what was it that kept calling you to open your eyes? </h4>
        <p> The only way to find out, is to go back to sleep. </p>
